# Hello ! You are currenlty in my Assembly Programs/Projects Lab

Here you can find solution inspiration for assembly programs

# Topics and Projects

### My first Assembly Program

- A program that reads a number from the user, calls a subroutine to increment the number, and prints the returned value.

----

### Factorial Output From User Input - [Recursion]

- A recursive program that asks the user for an unsigned 64-bit integer (n) and then prints the factorial (n!) of that number.

----

### Difference Between Two Files with flags -i & -B 
 
- The program is simplified my_diff function for performing a line-based comparison of two files. It checks every line and see if it is different in some way

---

### Fibonacci With Manually Allocating and Reallocating Memory - [Memory Management]

- This is all about saving and reusing results and some (slightly) more advanced user interaction. It works with explicit memory management (through functions like malloc, realloc, or free)

----

### My Printf Function - [Format Specifiers & Buffers]

- In this program I implemented my own printf function, that matches the original in quite some of its functionality. Original: (Linux man page: man printf)
