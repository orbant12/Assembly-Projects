# Introduction

This is a program that asks the user for an unsigned 64-bit integer (n) and then prints the factorial (n!) of that number.

- Main topic: Recursion

----

# Subroutine

The Subroutine have the following signature: uint64_t my_factorial(uint64_t n)

- As the name suggests, it will calculate the factorial of the given argument and return the result.

- Its implemented recursively

----

# Main Program

The main program should get the needed input from the user, call my_factorial to calculate the result, and finally print the result. The final program output should look like this:

```
    Enter a number: <n>
    <n>! = <n!>
```

- where <n> is the given input and <n!> is the factorial of n.
